# Parlios Hub Preview — Netlify Drop (v2)

This ZIP is hardened to avoid black-screen issues:
- No third‑party icon packages (inline SVG only)
- React/ReactDOM/Recharts via UMD CDN
- Tailwind CDN
- In‑page error reporter (if anything fails, you'll see a readable message)
- SPA 404 fallback

How to use:
1) Drop this ZIP on Netlify Drop.
2) Open the URL — you should see the Parlios Hub preview immediately.
