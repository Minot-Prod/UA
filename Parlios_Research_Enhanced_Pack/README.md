# Parlios Research Enhanced Pack — v1.0

Welcome to the **Parlios Research Enhanced Pack**, designed to supercharge your AI research phase before building new Parlios apps.
This toolkit allows any agent (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity…) to perform **deep market, UX, and product research** that guides the creation of high-impact, Netlify-ready applications.

## Purpose

Each file in this pack serves a unique role:

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `Parlios_Apps_Inventory.md` | List of all 38 Parlios apps with category, goal, and strategic priority |
| `Parlios_Research_Prompt_Universal_Enhanced.md` | The master research prompt to send to any external agent |
| `/examples/sample_research_report.md` | A detailed 10-page example report to show the expected structure and tone |
| `README.md` | You’re reading it — how to use the pack correctly |

## How to Use

1. Choose one app from the inventory file.
2. Copy the Enhanced Research Prompt.
3. Replace `[INSERT APP CATEGORY NAME]` with your chosen app’s name (e.g. “AI Copywriting Assistant”).
4. Send it to the external agent.
5. The agent will return a Markdown research report — save it in `/research/[app_name]_report.md`.
6. Once all reports are done, include them inside your **Founders BuildPack** (before building previews).

## Best Practices

- Always run the same prompt in **English**, to ensure consistent technical accuracy.
- When using Gemini or Perplexity, enable **Web Search / Grounding** to access real data.
- Save every report in Markdown for maximum reuse in Notion, GitHub, or your Parlios CMS.
- Each report should include: Competitor Table, UX Benchmark, Feature Patterns, Copy Insights, Innovation Radar, Business Fit Filter, Expert Build Brief.

## Integration in Founders BuildPack

Place each research report under `/Founders_BuildPack/research/`.
